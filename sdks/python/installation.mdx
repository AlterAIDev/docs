  <Card title="Zero Token Exposure" icon="lock">
    Tokens are never exposed to your code - all injection happens behind the scenes

  <Card title="Single Entry Point" icon="bullseye">
    One method (`vault.request()`) for calling any provider API
  </Card>

  <Card title="Actor Tracking" icon="robot">
    First-class support for AI agents and MCP servers with built-in observability

## Dependencies

The SDK has minimal dependencies:

- `httpx` - Async HTTP client with HTTP/2 and connection pooling
- `pydantic` - Data validation and settings management

No provider-specific dependencies are needed. The SDK works with **any** OAuth provider through a single generic `vault.request()` method. All HTTP methods are supported: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS.

## Architecture Notes

<Note>
  The SDK uses **two separate HTTP clients** for security:
  1. **Alter client** - Communicates with Alter Vault backend (includes your API key)
  2. **Provider client** - Calls external APIs like Google, GitHub, Slack (no API key, prevents credential leakage)
</Note>

<Warning>
  The SDK **does not cache tokens locally** by design. This ensures:
  - Real-time policy enforcement on every request
  - Instant revocation when users disconnect
  - Complete audit trail for compliance
  - Maximum security with no local token storage

  Backend Redis caching keeps response times under 10ms.
</Warning>
